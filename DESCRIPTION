Description: Test for overall association between the composition of a microbial community
             and a host phenotype of interest (e.g. disease status) with/without covariate adjustments. 
             In this package, we construct a novel community-level test, named MiAF,
             by adaptively combining p-values from OTU-level (univariate) tests.
